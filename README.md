# RedEngine-ResTool
Allows you to hotsample Cyberpunk 2077 and The Witcher 3

Inject with your favorite injector. Resize the window with SRWE like you normally would. That's it.

I advise turning off DLSS, or you will lose a lot of the benefit of the extra pixels.

Tested on both Steam and GOG versions. TW3 is the latest with raytracing.
